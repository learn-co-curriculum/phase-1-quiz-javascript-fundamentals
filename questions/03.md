# Fundamentals: Variables

Which of the following describes a variable that has been declared using `const`?

## Correct

It cannot be re-assigned or re-declared.

> Correct! Trying to re-assign or re-declare a variable that was initially
> declared using `const` would result in an error.

## Incorrect

It can be re-assigned, but not re-declared.

> Once a variable has been declared with the `const` keyword, it cannot be
> re-assigned. For example, this code would result in an error:
>
> ```javascript
> const pi = 3.14159;
> //=> undefined
> pi = 2.71828;
> //=> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
> ```

## Incorrect

It can be re-declared, but not re-assigned.

> Once a variable has been declared with the `const` keyword, it cannot be
> re-assigned **or** re-declared. For example, this code would result in an
> error:
>
> ```javascript
> const pi = 3.14159;
> //=> undefinedconst
> pi = 2.71828;
> //=> SyntaxError: Identifier 'pi' has already been declared
> ```

> Note that you will not be able to reproduce this error in the Chrome developer
> tools,
> [since the developer tools allow re-declarations of variables](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-92/#const-redeclaration).
> If you were to run this code in another environment though, an error would
> appear.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
